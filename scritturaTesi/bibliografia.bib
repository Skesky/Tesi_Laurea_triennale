abstract = {Abstract Quantum key distribution (QKD) using weak coherent states and homodyne detection is a promising candidate for practical quantum-cryptographic implementations due to its compatibility with existing telecom equipment and high detection efficiencies. However, despite the actual simplicity of the protocol, the security analysis of this method is rather involved compared to discrete-variable QKD. This article reviews the theoretical foundations of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) with Gaussian modulation and rederives the essential relations from scratch in a pedagogical way. The aim of this paper is to be as comprehensive and self-contained as possible in order to be well intelligible even for readers with little pre-knowledge on the subject. Although the present article is a theoretical discussion of CV-QKD, its focus lies on practical implementations, taking into account various kinds of hardware imperfections and suggesting practical methods to perform the security analysis subsequent to the key exchange. Apart from a review of well-known results, this manuscript presents a set of new original noise models which are helpful to get an estimate of how well a given set of hardware will perform in practice.},

ABSTRACT = {Long block length rate-compatible low-density parity-compatible (LDPC) codes are designed to solve the problems of great variation of quantum channel noise and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The existing rate-compatible methods for CV-QKD inevitably cost abundant hardware resources and waste secret key resources. In this paper, we propose a design rule of rate-compatible LDPC codes that can cover all potential SNRs with single check matrix. Based on this long block length LDPC code, we achieve high efficiency continuous-variable quantum key distribution information reconciliation with a reconciliation efficiency of 91.80% and we have higher hardware processing efficiency and lower frame error rate than other schemes. Our proposed LDPC code can obtain a high practical secret key rate and a long transmission distance in an extremely unstable channel.},

	abstract = {The speed at which two remote parties can exchange secret keys over a ﬁxed-length ﬁber-optic cable in continuousvariable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is currently limited by the computational complexity of post-processing algorithms for key reconciliation. Multi-edge low-density paritycheck (LDPC) codes with low code rates and long block lengths were proposed for CV-QKD, in order to extend the maximum reconciliation distance between the two remote parties. Key reconciliation over multiple dimensions has been shown to further improve the error-correction performance of multi-edge LDPC codes in CV-QKD, thereby increasing both the secret key rate and distance. However, the computational complexity of LDPC decoding for long block lengths on the order of 106 bits remains a challenge. This work introduces a quasi-cyclic (QC) code construction for multi-edge LDPC codes that is highly suitable for hardware-accelerated decoding on a modern graphics processing unit (GPU). When combined with an 8-dimensional reconciliation scheme, the LDPC decoder achieves a raw decoding throughput of 1.72Mbit/s and an information throughput of 7.16Kbit/s using an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU at a maximum distance of 160km with a secret key rate of 4.10×10−7 bits/pulse for a rate 0.02 multi-edge code with block length of 106 bits when ﬁnite-size effects are considered. This work extends the previous maximum CV-QKD distance of 100km to 160km, while delivering between 1.07× and 8.03× higher decoded information throughput over the upper bound on the secret key rate for a lossy channel. For distances beyond 130km, the GPU decoder delivers an information throughput between 1868× and 18790× higher than the achievable secret key rates with a 1MHz light source. The GPU-based QC-LDPC decoder achieves a 1.29× improvement in throughput over the best existing GPU decoder implementation for a rate 1/10 multi-edge LDPC code with block length of 220 bits. These results show that LDPC decoding is no longer the computational bottleneck in long-distance CV-QKD, and that the secret key rate remains limited only by the physical parameters of the quantum channel and the latency of privacy ampliﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Secure and efficient communication between two parties always incents scholars for further research. Creation of such a means of communication yields commercial benefits for our society. With the creation of a quantum computer, some classical protocols used for secure communication is no longer secure. Quantum key distribution is created to solve this problem. Although a quantum key distribution protocol is in theory guaranteed to be secure, there has been ways to breach its security in real life application. Since the creation of the first quantum key distribution protocol, there has been a rival between the defending and attacking side of quantum key distribution. In this paper, we first seek to discuss the basics of the first quantum key distribution protocol. Secondly, we discuss about the attacks against that protocol and the modifications made to the protocol in response to these attacks. Currently, researchers have permanently closed one side of the implementation loophole that could give rise to potential means of hacking of the protocol.},
